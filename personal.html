<h1>INFORMATION ABOUT ADAM SSEBATTA</h1>
<p> Adam Ssebatta is a son of Mr. Kimera Joseph and Mrs. Nansamba Mary
     of Kiweesa-Ssingo Mityana. Adam is a practising Muslim. 
     He was born in Mityana to Ugandan parents who migrated
      to Busunju from Mityana in 1980. He grew up in a small apartment in uganda.
       His father died shortly after Adam turned 11. 
       </p>
       <p>Adam Ssebatta was born as the first child of 
        four brothers and sisters. His dad died when he was very little.  
        From a very young age, the sense of responsibility befell him.
 
        The death of his dad left Ssebatta Adam's mother 
         with the saddling burden of parenting.
